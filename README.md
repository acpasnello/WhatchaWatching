# WhatchaWatching? - CS50w FinalProject

Movie and Series-based social network site where users can track their watch history, make lists, add their opinions, and see what friends are watching.

## Features
* User accounts with authentication
* Account relationship system with requests, friends, and blocking
* Activity feed of friends' recent list updates and ratings
* The Movie Database API integration for getting movie and series information
* SendGrid API integration to send emails to users
* Lazy loading images to improve load times

## Future Features
* I'd like to make the lists location dependent, i.e. if I am a user in the United States then I will see the most popular, top rated in the United States. Currently the Movie Database does not filter ratings and traffic by location.
